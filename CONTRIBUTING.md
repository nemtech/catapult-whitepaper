There are many ways to contribute, from submitting errors and requests or writing new pieces of documentation, which can be incorporated into the whitepaper itself.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

### Building catapult-whitepaper

Symbol Whitepaper is written using [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/), and converted into PDF files.

1. Fork catapult-whitepaper repository and clone it to your local machine. See [GitHub help page](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) for help.

2. Install the project requirements.

```sh
source ./texlive/texlive_install.sh
```

3. Build the whitepaper.

```sh
cd whitepaper
make latex
```

If everything goes well, the previous command should generate the PDF file ``_build/main.pdf``.

### Typographical conventions

In math and text mode:
 * Use `\nemsetting` to refer to configuration variables

In math mode:
 * Use `\mathfunc` to mark multi-letter functions, i.e. `\func{verify}(a, b, c)`
 * Use `\structField` to refer to cpp fields inside math mode, i.e. `\structField{X}{SomeField}`, right now, X should be single letter
 * Use `\mathvar` to refer to multi-letter, but single word variables
 * Use `\mathname` to refer to multi word variables

In text mode:
 * Use `\field` to refer to cpp field names.

### Submitting your changes

Once your changes and tests are ready to be submitted for review:

1. Preview your changes.

    Open the ``_build/main.pdf`` and check that the format does not break.

2. Submit a pull request.

    Push your local changes to your forked copy of the repository and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). In the pull request, choose a title that sums up the changes that you have made, and in the body provide more details about what your changes do. Also mention the number of the issue where the discussion has taken place, eg "Closes #123".

Then sit back and wait. There will probably be a discussion about the pull request and, if any changes are needed, we would love to work with you to get your pull request merged into catapult-whitepaper.
