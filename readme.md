In math and text mode:
 * Use `\nemsetting` to refer to configuration variables

In math mode:
 * Use `\mathfunc` to mark multi-letter functions, i.e. `\func{verify}(a, b, c)`
 * Use `\structField` to refer to cpp fields inside math mode, i.e. `\structField{X}{SomeField}`, right now, X should be single letter
 * Use `\mathvar` to refer to multi-letter, but single word variables
 * Use `\mathname` to refer to multi word variables

In text mode:
 * Use `\field` to refer to cpp field names.
